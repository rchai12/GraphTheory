This is a python canvas app that enables users to create their own graphs easily. It allows for user modification of the graph's objects such as moving nodes, editing edge weights and whether it is directed or undirected. 
Finally our app enables users to run one of different graphing algorithms through their graph to see the traversal and results. This app was made with the focus of education, so users can more easily learn
how different algorithms interact with graphs.
